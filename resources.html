      <section class="minimal-pairs">
         <div>
            <h2>Minimal Pairs</h2>
            <p>
            Minimal pairs are sets of words that differ only by one sound in the same 
            position in each word. These are used in speech therapy in order to help 
            with reorganizing a child's sound system. Using minimal pairs is a great 
            way to teach children about sounds, and how even ONE sound difference 
            creates a totally different word with a completely different meaning.  
            Examples of minimal pairs are: tea/key, thumb/dumb, make/cake, back/bat.
            </p>

            <p>
            Specifically, ‚ÄúBacking‚Äù minimal pairs are sets that focus on sounds 
            that are formed in the front of the mouth versus sounds that are generated 
            in the back of the mouth. If a child is struggling with differentiating 
            between ‚Äúfront‚Äù sounds versus ‚Äúback‚Äù sounds, these would be an excellent 
            way to practice hearing the difference and saying the different sounds.
            </p>

            <p>
            Furthermore, each set has words that are found in Dede‚Äôs Pet Shop. 
            T/D are front sounds, which is the focus of this book. Giving the 
            words context by using the story, will facilitate understanding and 
            usage of them.
