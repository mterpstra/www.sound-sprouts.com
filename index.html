            <h2>I&#39;m L. Caroline Terpstra</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I am a speech-language pathologist who has been working
            in the profession for over twenty-five years. Throughout my practice, 
            I found myself often reaching for books when introducing new concepts, 
            particularly with the younger children. But, I always felt it would be 
            fantastic, if the books would have a predetermined set of goals with 
            fun story lines. No brainer books! My love of books and literacy 
            prompted the idea of writing a book series. It gave me the opportunity 
            to pack into them early learning skills that are essential in a child's 
            development of speech sounds, language, and literacy.
